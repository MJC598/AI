These algorithms were written for Python 3. We ran them on a MacBook Pro on macOS High Sierra with a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor and 16 GB of Memory.

### Connect 4 AI with Minimax Tree Implementation

#### Heurisitc Implementation

```python
p_tto = len(player_three_two_open)
    p_too = len(player_three_one_open)
    p_to = len(player_two_open)

    o_tto = len(opponent_three_two_open)
    o_too = len(opponent_three_one_open)
    o_to = len(opponent_two_open)

    heuristic = (5 * p_tto) - (10 * o_tto) + (3 * p_too) - (6 * o_too) + p_to - o_to
```
